## About
Brick Hill+ is a browser extension that gives users access to features that Brick Hill hasn't implemented yet. 

## Downloads
Currently, the extension only supports [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brick-hill/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/brick-hill%20/hendnmfbkcgmpafikljbfhpgphdilohj?hl=en).

## Limitations
Brick Hill+ can only affect the front-end of Brick Hill's website. Features such as search by past usernames, sort the shop by specials, etc. are examples of back-end features where Brick Hill+ reaches its limitations.
